<strong>SDCTools</strong> is a react-enabled app to assist and reinforce accuracy and correctness for practitioners to record patient data through an easy-to-use and intuitive process. The application serves as a middleman to redesign "pen and paper" structure of the SDC form for versatility and minimization of human errors. We utilize and redesigned information from SDC standards that medical practitioners often refer to when they start their diagnosis, and syndicate this information in a way that is <strong>mobile</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>modern</strong>.

1. Run `npm install` in both [frontend/](/frontend/) and [backend/](/backend/) folders.
2. Then simultaneously buidling and starting the frontend and backend development servers by running:

```

## Instructions

Start by following the instructions in the [Contributing Guide](#Contributing_Guide) section above to install dependencies and run the application development server. When you load up the app in your browser, you should see the application Home screen.

### Filling out data

Once you selected your form and the patient in question, you can create a new draft to be filled out. After completing the form, you can save it for future references. And that particular form will be associated with 1 patient.

### Getting saved draft 

To access a previously saved form, we can simply go to the patient's profile and search for their related forms.

## Motivation

Many of the tools being used in the industry are old and are not flexible. We went out to try and develop a solution that is easy to use and adapt, even for the freshest of practitioners. We also want a good grade.
